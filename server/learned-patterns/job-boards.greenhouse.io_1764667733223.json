    "question_14642600004": "I understand that if I am not currently located in Raleigh, NC, advance relocation will be required for consideration, and I confirm that I am prepared to relocate as needed.\n\nI am enthusiastic about the opportunity to join a Raleigh-based team and have successfully relocated for roles in the past. At Tech Corp I coordinated a cross-country move to join a distributed engineering team, ensuring a seamless transition while maintaining full productivity. At StartupXYZ I again relocated for a role where I quickly integrated into the local engineering organization and led projects to migrate critical services to AWS and Docker-based deployments.\n\nMy technical background—building production React front-ends and Node.js/Python backends, running services on AWS with Docker and PostgreSQL—means I can hit the ground running post-relocation. I’m organized, experienced with remote/on-site transitions, and comfortable handling logistics and timelines to make relocation efficient for both myself and the hiring team. I acknowledge the relocation requirement and am prepared to move to Raleigh with advance planning.",
