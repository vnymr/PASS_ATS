    "cover_letter": "I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer role at Test Company. As a Senior Software Engineer at Tech Corp (2020–Present), I have over 5 years of professional experience building and operating production systems, and I am eager to bring that experience to your team. My background combines hands-on engineering, ownership of cloud infrastructure, and collaboration across product and operations teams to deliver reliable, scalable services.\n\nAt Tech Corp I led development of our cloud infrastructure: migrating core services to AWS, implementing Infrastructure-as-Code practices, and building automation for CI/CD pipelines. For example, I led a migration project that consolidated several monolithic deployments into containerized services on AWS, introduced Terraform for repeatable infrastructure, and implemented automated deployments through a CI pipeline. These changes improved deployment frequency, reduced recovery time from incidents, and lowered cloud spend through right-sizing and automation. I regularly used Python and Node.js for tooling and backend work, and partnered with frontend teams using React to ship end-to-end features.\n\nI am particularly drawn to Test Company because of its focus on building reliable, customer-focused software at scale. I bring strong technical skills in JavaScript, Python, Node.js, React and AWS, a mindset of continuous improvement, and experience mentoring engineers and driving cross-functional projects to completion. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience leading cloud infrastructure and delivering production software can contribute to Test Company's engineering goals.",
