    "question_33402666002": "I do not require any accommodations for typical interview formats, but I greatly appreciate teams that prioritize inclusive practices. In my current role at TechCorp, I built and maintained onboarding and architecture documentation designed for clarity and accessibility — using clear headings, consistent structure, and screen-reader friendly markdown rendering — which reduced ramp time for new engineers by two weeks on average.\n\nWhen accommodations are needed for team members, I proactively implement practical changes: scheduling interviews or collaborative sessions within workable time zones, enabling live captions for remote meetings, and providing interview materials in advance so candidates can prepare. For example, while leading a cross-functional initiative at TechCorp, I coordinated recorded walkthroughs and annotated diagrams for stakeholders who preferred asynchronous review, which improved discussion quality and ensured full participation.\n\nIf there are specific adjustments you'd recommend or provide (e.g., live captioning, extended time for technical assessments, or alternative interview formats), I will gladly accept them or coordinate timing/materials to ensure the best possible interview experience for everyone involved.",
