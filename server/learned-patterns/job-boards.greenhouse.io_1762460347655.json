    "question_33402666002": "Thank you for prioritizing an accessible and inclusive interview experience. I do not require any ongoing accommodations for interviews by default, and I am comfortable participating via video conferencing (Zoom, Google Meet) or by phone. I work on Central Time (UTC-6/UTC-5 as applicable) and am available for interviews on weekdays between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM CT; if needed I can occasionally make myself available earlier or later with advance notice.\n\nWhen helpful, I appreciate having an agenda and any technical instructions in writing ahead of time (e.g., systems to access, repos or sample code to review). In prior roles at TechCorp and StartupXYZ I collaborated with globally distributed teams across the US and EMEA; providing written prompts or sample artifacts in advance improved the efficiency and fairness of technical discussions. If any live coding exercises are required, I am happy to do them in a shared document or in an environment where a copy of the prompt is available in text form.\n\nIf additional accommodations become necessary at any stage (for example, preference for closed captions, transcripts of recorded sessions, or extended time for a take-home assignment), I will request them promptly. I value GitLab's emphasis on accessibility and collaboration and am committed to working with your team to ensure a smooth, inclusive process for everyone involved.",
