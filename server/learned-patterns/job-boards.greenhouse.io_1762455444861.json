    "cover_letter": "I am excited to apply and bring 6+ years of experience in product-focused analytics and IT management to your team. My graduate education at the University of Texas at Dallas sharpened my ability to align technical work with strategic goals, and my roles at SYNYCS TECHNOLOGIES and theworkgallery.com gave me hands-on experience building data products, dashboards, and customer-facing features. I have led cross-functional efforts using Scrum and Kanban, ensuring clear priorities and rapid, quality deliveries.\n\nIn my previous roles I built and maintained analytics dashboards and reporting pipelines using Tableau and Power BI, and implemented SQL- and Python-based ETL processes to ensure reliable data for decision making. I partnered directly with product managers and stakeholders to define success metrics and created dashboards that enabled stakeholders to act on insights quickly. I enjoy balancing hands-on technical contributions with mentoring colleagues on agile practices and data literacy.\n\nI am particularly excited about roles that combine analytics, product thinking, and cross-team collaboration. My portfolio (https://vinay.portfolio) highlights examples of dashboard work and product initiatives. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills in data visualization, analytics engineering, and Agile delivery can support your team and drive measurable outcomes.",
