    "cover_letter": "I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at Test Company. As a Senior Software Engineer at Tech Corp (2020 - Present), I have led development of cloud infrastructure and platform initiatives that improved reliability and enabled faster feature delivery. Over the past 5 years I have designed and implemented services using AWS, Node.js, and Python, and built front-end features with React and JavaScript. My engineering approach balances pragmatic delivery with long-term maintainability; I partner closely with product and operations teams to ensure infrastructure meets real-world scale and security requirements.\n\nAt Tech Corp I led a cross-functional effort to re-architect our deployment and monitoring stack on AWS, collaborating with SRE and backend teams to introduce automated pipelines and observability tooling. I was the technical lead for the infrastructure workstream, coordinating design reviews, driving implementation, and mentoring engineers on best practices for cloud-native development. This experience gave me deep familiarity with serverless and containerized architectures, CI/CD automation, and cost-aware design â€” all directly relevant to Test Company's goal of building robust, scalable systems.\n\nI hold a BS in Computer Science from Stanford University (2018) and bring strong full-stack experience across JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, and AWS. I am motivated by Test Company's mission and excited by the opportunity to contribute to a team that values engineering rigor and rapid iteration. I look forward to discussing how my background building cloud infrastructure and leading technical projects can help Test Company deliver reliable, user-focused products.",
