    "unnamed_5": "I am an experienced software engineer with a strong foundation in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Python, and practical production experience deploying services on AWS with Docker and PostgreSQL. At Tech Corp I focused on building scalable front-end applications using React and worked closely with backend teams to design Node.js APIs; I also participated in CI/CD pipeline improvements and containerization efforts to streamline deployments. At StartupXYZ I wore multiple hats—implementing user-facing features, iterating quickly on product requirements, and taking ownership of end-to-end delivery from design to production.\n\nMy approach combines pragmatic engineering with a focus on user impact: I prioritize clear, maintainable code and automations that reduce manual work for engineering teams. I bring a collaborative mindset—mentoring junior engineers, partnering with product managers, and collaborating with designers—to deliver high-quality features on schedule. My skillset (React, Node.js, Python, AWS, Docker, PostgreSQL) aligns well with modern full-stack engineering needs and positions me to contribute immediately to product and infrastructure initiatives.",

I am currently based in San Francisco, CA and I acknowledge the relocation requirement. I am prepared to make arrangements to relocate to Raleigh to join the team and understand the importance of being on-site as required by the role.\n\nI am able to relocate within a reasonable timeframe and would target a 45–90 day window to complete logistics, secure housing, and transition responsibilities at my current commitments. I am comfortable coordinating with your relocation resources and can provide a specific relocation timeline as part of next-step conversations. I appreciate the transparency on relocation expectations and remain enthusiastic about making the move to contribute fully on-site.",
