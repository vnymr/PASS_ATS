At TechCorp (2020–Present) I led efforts to integrate security into the CI/CD lifecycle, implemented automated dependency and container scanning in Jenkins and GitLab CI, and worked cross-functionally with product and security teams to prioritize remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities.\n\nPrior to TechCorp, at StartupXYZ (2018–2020) I built the core Node.js services and introduced infrastructure-as-code practices on AWS, which improved deployment reliability and allowed us to enforce security guardrails more consistently. I am excited to bring hands-on engineering leadership, a deep familiarity with cloud and container technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes), and practical experience embedding security controls into development workflows to the Director of Engineering, Security Risk Management role.",

    "question_33402666002": "I welcome an inclusive interview experience and appreciate the opportunity to share any adjustments that make the process most effective. As a remote-based candidate, I find it helpful when technical interviews provide clear instructions and materials in advance (for example, problem statements, API schemas, or architecture diagrams). When coding exercises are part of the process, having a brief written rubric or the goals of the exercise ahead of time helps me align my approach to the team’s expectations and demonstrate my design and security-oriented thinking.\n\nFor live interviews, I appreciate having access to captions or a live transcript when possible, and an option to use screen sharing with a shared link rather than forcing a particular conferencing client. If an interview includes a whiteboard session, I value digital whiteboarding tools so I can share diagrams and notes that remain visible after the meeting. These accommodations let me focus on demonstrating technical leadership, threat modeling, and system design in a way that represents my abilities accurately.\n\nIf there are any specific formats your team prefers for architecture discussions or take-home assignments, I’m happy to conform; providing those preferences in advance helps me prepare examples of past work (for example, CI/CD security automations I led at TechCorp) that are directly relevant to the role.",
