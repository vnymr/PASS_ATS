    "question_33402666002": "I do not require specific accommodations to participate in the interview process. I am comfortable with phone, video, live coding and take-home assignments, and I can provide any required materials or links in advance. For scheduling, I am based in Dallas, TX (Central Time) and generally prefer morning interview slots, though I routinely coordinate across time zones and can be flexible.\n\nIf accommodations are helpful for other candidates or the interview team, I am fully supportive of adjustments such as providing written prompts in advance, offering asynchronous take-home technical exercises, or allowing extended time for coding tasks. In my role at TechCorp I coordinated distributed interviews and technical evaluations across US and EMEA teams using tools such as Zoom, GitHub, and CI/CD pipelines — I’ve found that clear written instructions and take-home exercises often lead to a better assessment of engineering and leadership skills.\n\nAs someone who collaborates closely with security and platform teams, I appreciate interview processes that enable candidates to demonstrate secure engineering practices (for example, discussions around secure CI/CD pipelines, container hardening, or architectural threat modeling). If you have any suggested formats or materials you’d like me to prepare in advance—for example, a short design or security risk assessment example based on my past work—I’m happy to provide those and to discuss any reasonable accommodations that help ensure an inclusive, high-quality interview experience.",
