    "coverLetter": "I am excited to apply for roles where I can bring together my product management experience, technical background, and analytics skills to create measurable customer value. Throughout my career I have worked at the intersection of engineering, data, and user experience — at SYNYCS TECHNOLOGIES I translated user research and stakeholder priorities into a clear product backlog and coordinated cross-functional sprints using Jira and Scrum. I partnered with data engineers and analysts to instrument features and built Tableau and Power BI dashboards that made performance visible to the entire organization, enabling faster, data-driven decisions.\n\nAt theworkgallery.com I embraced Lean Startup practices to run rapid experiments and validate product hypotheses. I collaborated with front-end engineers working in React to deliver user-facing improvements while using SQL and Python to analyze behavioral data and guide prioritization. These experiences sharpened my ability to communicate technical constraints to non-technical stakeholders and to convert insights into pragmatic roadmaps and deliverables.\n\nI bring not only technical fluency but also a culture-first approach: I value transparent communication, continuous improvement, and mentorship. I enjoy creating the processes and measurement practices that help teams move faster and with confidence. I am enthusiastic about opportunities where I can apply my mix of analytics, product strategy, and hands-on execution to help teams build products customers love.",
