If possible, I value receiving an agenda and any technical prompts or take-home exercises 24–48 hours in advance so I can prepare thoughtful and thorough responses.\n\nIn previous roles at SYNYCS TECHNOLOGIES and theworkgallery.com I frequently collaborated with distributed teams across time zones and found that having clear agendas, expected timeframes for each interview segment, and access to shared documents ahead of time improved outcomes for everyone. If an accommodation becomes necessary (for example, captioning or alternative format materials), I will communicate that promptly and appreciate the team’s support.",
