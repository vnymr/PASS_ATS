    "question_33402666002": "I welcome an inclusive, accessible interview experience and a few simple adjustments help me perform at my best. I appreciate clear scheduling with time-zone-aware calendar invites, any pre-read materials in accessible digital formats (PDF/HTML), and the option to receive technical questions in writing before or during a live interview when feasible. In previous interview processes I found it most effective when coding challenge instructions and evaluation criteria were provided ahead of time so I can prepare and demonstrate my best work.\n\nFor live interviews, I value the option of short breaks between sessions and the ability to use accessible tooling (e.g., a larger-font editor, screen-reader compatible links, or captions for video calls). If there are technical exercises that require setup, I also appreciate the option to run them in a cloud sandbox or provide a remote pairing environment so I can focus on architecture and secure design rather than local environment issues. I'm happy to discuss any specific accommodations in advance to ensure a smooth process.",
