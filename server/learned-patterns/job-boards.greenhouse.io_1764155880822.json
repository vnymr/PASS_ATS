Over the course of my career I have built and operated production systems that serve thousands of users, leveraging JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, AWS, Docker, and PostgreSQL. At Tech Corp, I led the front-end redevelopment of a core customer dashboard using React and TypeScript, which improved load performance and user engagement; I collaborated with backend engineers to create efficient Node.js APIs and introduced Docker-based development workflows that reduced onboarding time for new engineers by 40%.\n\nAt StartupXYZ I shipped multiple end-to-end features under tight timelines while maintaining high quality. I designed and implemented a microservice supporting user analytics on AWS, using Python for data processing, Docker for containerization, and PostgreSQL for reliable storage. That service reduced data processing latency by nearly 30% and enabled new product insights that drove prioritized feature development. I have experience owning features from design through deployment and monitoring, and I regularly worked with cross-functional teams (product, design, QA) to deliver customer-focused solutions.\n\nI hold a BS in Computer Science from Stanford University and bring approximately 7 years of professional software development experience. I thrive in collaborative, high-ownership environments and am eager to contribute to a team building scalable, user-centered products. My blend of front-end and backend skills, cloud and DevOps experience, and history of delivering measurable improvements will allow me to add immediate value to your engineering organization.",
