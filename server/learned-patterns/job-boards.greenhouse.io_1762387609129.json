    "cover_letter": "Dear Hiring Team,\n\nI am excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at Test Company. I am John Doe, a Senior Software Engineer at Tech Corp since 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University (2018). Over the past five years I have led development of cloud infrastructure and backend services, and I bring hands-on experience with JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, and AWS. My background delivering production systems at scale and collaborating across product and operations teams makes me well-suited to contribute immediately to your engineering efforts.\n\nAt Tech Corp I led the effort to redesign our cloud platform—migrating a legacy monolith to a microservices architecture on AWS, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and introducing observability and automated recovery mechanisms. I personally authored core services in Node.js and Python, and partnered with front-end engineers on React-driven interfaces. Those changes reduced deployment cycle time by over 50%, significantly improved reliability, and enabled the team to iterate faster on customer-facing features. I focus on pragmatic, well-tested engineering and on mentoring teammates to elevate overall delivery quality.\n\nI’m particularly drawn to Test Company’s focus on building reliable, user-focused products. I enjoy working cross-functionally, thrive in fast-moving environments, and am motivated by opportunities to improve systems end-to-end. I am located in San Francisco, CA, and you can find more about my work at https://johndoe.dev and on LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe. Thank you for considering my application—I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",
