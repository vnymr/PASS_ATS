    "question_33402666002": "I do not require specific accessibility accommodations at this time, but I appreciate an inclusive interview approach and a chance to request adjustments if needed. In the past at TechCorp I worked across distributed teams in the US and EMEA and found that offering recordings, written summaries, and flexible scheduling significantly improved collaboration and participation for teammates with varying needs.\n\nIf helpful, I prefer interview schedules that consider time zone differences (Central Time) and appreciate short written agendas or bullet-point topics ahead of time so I can prepare focused examples (for example, CI/CD security improvements I led at TechCorp). I also find captioned video calls and the option to switch to a chat-based Q&A useful for technical whiteboarding or detailed code walkthroughs.\n\nIf any accommodations would make the process easier (adjusted timing, extended Q&A time, or alternative formats for technical tasks), I’m happy to coordinate with your recruiting team. I value an accessible process and am glad to work with you to ensure interviews are productive for everyone.",
