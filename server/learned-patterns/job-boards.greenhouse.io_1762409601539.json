    "cover_letter": "I am excited to apply for the Customer Excellence Analyst role at Nu. As a Senior Software Engineer at TechCorp (2020–Present) and previously as a Software Engineer at StartupXYZ (2018–2020), I have built my career around delivering reliable, customer-focused products and tools. At TechCorp I led cross-functional initiatives partnering closely with customer support and product teams to surface the highest-impact customer issues, implement automated triage and monitoring, and ship features that reduced support escalations and improved customer satisfaction. My technical background (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes) allows me to both understand the root causes of customer experiences and build solutions that prevent recurring incidents.\n\nBeyond delivering technical solutions, I have consistently prioritized clear, empathetic communication with stakeholders and customers. I built an internal dashboard at TechCorp that aggregated customer-reported issues, service health metrics, and product telemetry; this made it faster for support and engineering to diagnose problems collaboratively and allowed the support team to provide more precise, confident updates to customers. At StartupXYZ I worked directly with customer service teams to translate qualitative customer feedback into product improvements, contributing to feature decisions and documentation that reduced repeated inquiries and improved first-contact resolution.\n\nI am energized by Nu’s mission to fight complexity and empower customers — it aligns with my approach of simplifying technical complexity into actionable, customer-facing improvements. I bring a data-driven mindset, hands-on technical skills, and proven experience partnering with support teams to create measurable improvements in customer experience. I am available and flexible to work shifts such as Tuesday–Saturday and schedules that end at midnight. Thank you for considering my application; I’m enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to Nu’s Customer Excellence community and would welcome the chance to discuss how my background can help drive outstanding outcomes for your customers.",
