    "unnamed_5": "I am a senior software engineer with a BS in Computer Science from Stanford University and over a decade of hands-on experience building scalable web applications. At Tech Corp I led a team to migrate a monolithic Rails/Node codebase to a microservices architecture using Node.js, Docker, and AWS ECS, reducing service deployment time by 60% and improving end-to-end request latency by 40%. At StartupXYZ I architected and implemented a customer-facing React single-page application backed by Node.js APIs and PostgreSQL, which contributed to a 25% increase in user retention over six months.\n\nMy core strengths are full-stack JavaScript (React, Node.js), Python for backend automation, and cloud-native deployments on AWS. I routinely design CI/CD pipelines, containerize services with Docker, and optimize relational databases (PostgreSQL) for high-concurrency workloads. For example, at Tech Corp I led a database indexing and query-refactoring effort that reduced a critical analytics query from 12s to 1.2s and saved significant compute cost in our reporting pipeline.\n\nI enjoy working in collaborative, product-focused teams and mentoring engineers on best practices. I bring a pragmatic, metrics-driven approach to solving problems, and I’m excited to apply my experience in building reliable, performant systems to contribute immediately to product and infrastructure goals.",
