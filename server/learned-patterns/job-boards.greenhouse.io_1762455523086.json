    "question_33402666002": "I do not require any specific accommodations to participate in the interview process, but I appreciate and support an inclusive approach and am happy to request reasonable adjustments if needed. Throughout my career at SYNYCS TECHNOLOGIES and theworkgallery.com I have worked on cross-functional teams that valued clear communication and accessible documentation. For example, while leading product and analytics initiatives I ensured all sprint artifacts in Jira and Trello were well-labeled, included alt text for visuals, and were accompanied by written summaries so teammates with different working styles and accessibility needs could contribute effectively.\n\nTo make the interview process as productive as possible, I value clear agendas and advance access to any technical exercises or case study prompts. When I participated in remote technical evaluations, having the problem statement and sample data ahead of time allowed me to prepare focused solutions using Python and SQL and present reproducible notebooks and visualizations (Tableau/Power BI) during the interview. If helpful, I can provide examples of dashboards, Python notebooks, and documentation beforehand. I’m flexible on format (live coding, take-home exercise, or presentation) and appreciate options such as extra time, closed captions, or alternative formats when they are needed.",
