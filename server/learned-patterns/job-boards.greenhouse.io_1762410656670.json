    "question_61004375": "Throughout my six years in technology roles I have frequently worked in customer-facing contexts across email, chat, and phone channels—even when my formal title was Software Engineer. At TechCorp (2020–Present) I led cross-functional triage and incident-response efforts for high-impact customer issues: I collaborated directly with support teams to diagnose production problems, created a prioritized runbook and internal tooling that reduced mean time to resolution by approximately a third, and authored customer-facing documentation that cut repetitive support inquiries. These responsibilities required strong written and verbal communication, empathy for frustrated users, and the ability to translate technical root causes into clear, actionable guidance for customers and front-line teams.\n\nAt StartupXYZ (2018–2020) I worked closely with early customers to onboard integrations, handle technical questions over chat and email, and iterate on self-service flows based on direct feedback. I built dashboards and monitoring that surfaced common user pain points, enabling the support team to proactively reach out and reduce churn. That blend of hands-on customer interaction, technical problem solving, and process improvement has given me practical experience delivering excellent outcomes across email, telephone, and chat channels—experience I’m excited to bring to Nu’s Customer Excellence team.",
