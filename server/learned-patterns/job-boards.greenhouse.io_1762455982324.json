I thrive in remote interview settings and have participated in multi-stage technical interviews, pairing sessions, and asynchronous coding exercises without any accommodations. If an adjustment were needed, I would request clear scheduling windows and the option to use screen-reader-friendly materials or extra time for timed coding tasks.\n\nIn prior backend roles I worked closely with hiring teams to ensure interviews were fair and accessible: I helped structure take-home exercises with clear acceptance criteria, documented APIs with examples and edge-case behaviors, and participated in mock interviews to surface and remove biases in technical evaluation. If selected, I am happy to work with your recruiting team to specify any accommodations in advance so that the interview experience is inclusive and effective for everyone.",
