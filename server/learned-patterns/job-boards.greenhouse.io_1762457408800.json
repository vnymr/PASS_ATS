    "unnamed_7": "I am a results-driven Senior Software Engineer with 6 years of experience building and scaling secure, cloud-native systems. At TechCorp I have led cross-functional initiatives to integrate security earlier in the development lifecycle by embedding automated dependency and container scanning into CI/CD pipelines, hardening Kubernetes deployments, and improving AWS IAM practices. I routinely collaborate with SRE and security teams to translate risk findings into prioritized engineering work and measurable remediation plans.\n\nOne representative effort involved partnering with security and product teams to create an automated pipeline that performed dependency scanning, container image scanning, and infrastructure-as-code checks during merge requests. I defined the acceptance criteria, implemented the pipeline using GitLab CI-style patterns, and worked with engineers to streamline remediation workflows. This initiative increased vulnerability detection earlier in development, improved developer turnaround on fixes, and reduced the number of high-severity issues reaching production.\n\nI am energized by the opportunity to lead an engineering team focused on Security Risk Management. My technical breadth (Node.js, Python, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, CI/CD) combined with hands-on experience integrating security tooling and mentoring engineers makes me well-suited to drive scalable, developer-friendly security programs. I welcome a remote role that partners across time zones to embed security as a core part of the software delivery lifecycle.",
