I am happy to participate in standard remote interviews (video calls, take-home exercises, and live technical screens). If necessary, I appreciate scheduling flexibility to accommodate different time zones, advance access to technical test requirements or rubrics, and the option for captioning on video calls.\n\nIn previous roles at TechCorp and StartupXYZ I regularly collaborated with distributed teams across multiple time zones and coordinated hiring and interview processes that included candidates with varied accessibility needs. To ensure an inclusive experience, I’m happy to accept calendar invites in multiple time zones, receive materials in advance in accessible formats (e.g., text-based or screen-reader friendly), or arrange alternative formats for timed exercises if that would better demonstrate a candidate’s abilities.",
