## 🚀 What Happens When You Deploy

### **Automatic Flow:**

```
1. Server starts
   ↓
2. Wait 30 seconds (initialization)
   ↓
3. AUTO-SYNC TRIGGERS
   ↓
4. Fetches jobs from 550 companies (parallel)
   - Greenhouse: ~7,000 jobs
   - Lever: ~100 jobs
   - Remotive: ~1,500 jobs
   - Ashby: ~200 jobs
   ↓
5. Saves to database (~8,000-10,000 jobs)
   ↓
6. REPEATS EVERY 6 HOURS (4x/day)
   ↓
7. Database maintains 20,000-25,000 active jobs
```

---

## 📈 Expected Results

### **First Sync (on deploy):**
```
✅ 8,000-10,000 jobs fetched
✅ All have direct URLs
✅ 80-90% AI-applyable
✅ All posted within last 7 days
✅ postedDate tracked
```

### **After 1 Week:**
```
📊 Database: 20,000-25,000 active jobs
📊 New jobs/day: ~3,000
📊 Syncs/day: 4 (every 6 hours)
📊 Companies: 550
```

### **Sample Job Data:**
```json
{
  "id": "greenhouse_7297049",
  "title": "Senior Software Engineer",
  "company": "stripe",
  "location": "San Francisco, CA",
  "postedDate": "2025-10-15T10:30:00Z",  // ✅ 2 days ago
  "applyUrl": "https://stripe.com/jobs/search?gh_jid=7297049",  // ✅ Direct!
  "atsType": "GREENHOUSE",
  "atsConfidence": 1.0,
  "aiApplyable": true,
  "source": "greenhouse"
}
```

---

## 📅 Job Posting Dates - Working!

### **Database Field:**
- `postedDate` (DateTime) - When job was originally posted

### **Sources:**
- **Greenhouse**: Uses `updated_at` from API
- **Lever**: Uses `createdAt` from API
- **Remotive**: Uses `publication_date` from API

### **Frontend Display:**
You can now show:
- ✅ "Posted 2 days ago"
- ✅ "Posted today"
- ✅ "Posted this week"
- ✅ Filter by date range

### **Database Query Example:**
```javascript
// Get jobs posted in last 3 days
const recentJobs = await prisma.aggregatedJob.findMany({
  where: {
    isActive: true,
    postedDate: {
      gte: new Date(Date.now() - 3 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
    }
  },
  orderBy: { postedDate: 'desc' }
});
```

- ❌ 55,992 Adzuna jobs from database
- ❌ `/server/lib/job-aggregator-with-ats.js` (archived as `.OLD`)

- ❌ All redirect URLs

### **Verified:**
- ✅ 0 Adzuna jobs in database
- ✅ 0 adzuna.com URLs
