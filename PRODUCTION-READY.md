## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Get Gemini API Key (Required)
```bash
# Visit: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
# Create a new API key (it's free to start)
```

### 2. Add to Railway Environment
```bash
railway variables set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

Or in Railway dashboard:
- Go to your project
- Click "Variables"
- Add: `GEMINI_API_KEY` = `your_key`

### 3. Verify OpenAI Key (Fallback)
Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is still set in Railway as fallback.

### 4. Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Optimize for 1000+ users - 99% cost reduction"
git push
```

### 5. Verify Deployment
Check Railway logs for:
```
✅ Gemini AI initialized (PRIMARY)
✅ OpenAI initialized (FALLBACK)
✅ Cache enabled
```

---

## 🔍 Monitoring

### What to Watch:

1. **Cache Performance**
   ```
   ✅ Resume parsing: CACHE HIT - saving $$$ on AI
   ✅ Job info: CACHE HIT - saving $$$ on AI
   ✅ ATS keywords: CACHE HIT - saving $$$ on AI
   ```

2. **AI Provider**
   ```
   Generating with Gemini  ← Should see this 99% of time
   Generating with OpenAI  ← Only on Gemini failures
   ```

3. **Database**
   - Connection pool usage should stay under 80%

4. **Cost**
   - Monthly AI costs should drop from $10k → $60

### Railway Metrics:
- CPU: Should stay under 70%
- Memory: Should stay under 80%
- Database connections: ~100-150 active (out of 200)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Gemini API Quotas:
- **Free Tier**: 15 requests/min
- **Paid Tier**: Higher limits
- System auto-falls back to OpenAI if quota exceeded

### If Gemini is Down:
- ✅ Automatic fallback to OpenAI
- ✅ No user-facing errors
- ⚠️ Costs will temporarily increase

### Database Connections:
- Ensure Railway PostgreSQL supports 200 connections
- Check your plan limits

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Test syntax
node --check server/lib/resume-parser.js
node --check server/lib/job-processor.js
node --check server/lib/ai-client.js
node --check server/lib/cache-manager.js

# Run load test
node test-final-load.js
```

### Production Testing:
1. Upload a resume (should see Gemini logs)
2. Upload same resume again (should see CACHE HIT)
3. Generate resume for same job (should see CACHE HIT)

## 💡 Future Optimizations (Optional)

If you grow beyond 1000 users:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Deploy multiple worker instances
   - Scale API servers with load balancer

2. **Database Read Replicas**
   - Offload read queries
   - Further reduce primary DB load

3. **CDN for Frontend**
   - Cloudflare or CloudFront
   - Faster asset delivery

4. **Advanced Caching**
   - Increase cache TTLs
   - Add more aggressive caching

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Railway logs
2. Verify GEMINI_API_KEY is set
3. Check cache is enabled (Redis running)
4. Verify database connections < 200
